# N-Queens

This project implements an interactive 8 Queens Puzzle using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where users manually place queens on a chessboard following these rules: 

1. Each row, column, and diagonal can only contain one queen.
2. Queens cannot be adjacent to each other (including diagonals).
